## What is it?

我是在参加2020届秋招的时候，实际上那时候往前2个月我才开始系统接触前端领域。为了快速提升知识掌握程度，并且在需要的时候能够快速检索某个知识点，我创建了这个项目。这个项目可以看作是我个人平时的学习笔记，因此我对它的命名就是fe-notes。不同于零零散散的daily-notes，fe-notes是在daily-notes基础上归纳得到的，相较而言更加系统化。

fe-notes的每一个目录是我已经有一定了解，并且还在持续更新的知识聚合点。有的文件夹目前可能为空，但是我会利用空余时间一点一点地完善。对于我来说，工作日我的笔记都存放在daily-notes，没有足够的时间整理那些零散的笔记。因此我会定期在周末腾出一点时间来归纳汇总。

我想通过这种方式，一步步地完善自己的知识体系，让自己能够看到自身的成长，并为此欢欣鼓舞。我相信也有和我一样刚参加工作的小伙伴，也在思考着用同样的方式记录自己的学习历程，所以欢迎大家一起互相学习、借鉴，并变得越来越优秀。

> I was participating in the 2020 Autumn Recruitment. In fact, I only started to touch the front-end field two months before that time. In order to quickly improve the degree of knowledge mastery, and to quickly retrieve a certain knowledge point when needed, I created this project. This project can be regarded as my personal study notes, so I named it fe-notes. Different from the scattered daily-notes, fe-notes are summarized on the basis of daily-notes, which is more systematic in comparison.

> Each catalog of fe-notes is a knowledge gathering point that I have already understood and are still updating. Some folders may be empty at the moment, but I will use my spare time to improve them bit by bit. For me, my notes are stored in daily-notes on weekdays, and there is not enough time to organize the scattered notes. Therefore, I will regularly spare some time on weekends to summarize.

> In this way, I want to improve my knowledge system step by step, so that I can see my own growth, and I am excited about it. I believe that there are also small partners who have just started work like me who are also thinking about recording their own learning journey in the same way, so everyone is welcome to learn from each other, learn from each other, and become better and better.
